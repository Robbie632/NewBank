# Getting started

---

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Robbie632/NewBank.git
```

## Running the application

To run and interact with the bank you need to 

### Compile the code

#### Option 1 - Use Intellij

If using Intellij the open up the project and navigate the Main.java file and click play

#### Option 2 - From the command line

Navigate to the root of the project and run the command below. (This compiles all the code and outputs it into a directory called ``'out'``)

```bash
javac -d ./out ./client/*.java ./server/*.java ./Main.java
```

To start the application run (This runs the compiled Main file within the out directory)

```bash
java -classpath ./out/ Main
```

<br>

## Logging In

---

The cli tool currently has a hardcoded set of users that it checks when you log in. To create a new user you need to 
manually go into the ``NewBank.java`` class and add yourself in the method below. Then re-compile and run the code 
steps from above


````java
	private void addTestData() {
		Customer bhagy = new Customer();
		//set password
		bhagy.setPassword("1");
		bhagy.addAccount(new Account("Main", 1000.0));
		bhagy.addAccount(new Account("Savings", 1000.0));
		customers.put("b", bhagy);
		
		Customer christina = new Customer();
		//set password
		christina.setPassword("2");
		christina.addAccount(new Account("Savings", 1500.0));
		christina.addAccount(new Account("Main", 100.0));
		customers.put("c", christina);
		
		Customer john = new Customer();
		//set password
		john.setPassword("3");
		john.addAccount(new Account("Main", 250.0));
		john.addAccount(new Account("Savings", 250.0));
		customers.put("j", john);

		/* Create  a new user here by uncommenting the below and setting values  */

//		Customer john = new Customer();
//		john.addAccount(new Account("Checking", 250.0));
